Welcome to my C++ repository, where I share my project developed as part of my digital games practices to improve my analysis and development of systems.

## Project description

### AsteroidsCPP
This project consists of creating the classic game “Asteroids”, entirely developed in C++ and using the SFML graphics library. The objective was to overcome the challenge of building a game from scratch, without resorting to pre-existing game development engines. The result is a robust version of “Asteroids” that includes a highscore system and the possibility of improving the spaceship, features implemented in a separate window.
